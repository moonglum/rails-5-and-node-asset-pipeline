# Example for a Rails 5 app with a Node asset pipeline

Based on @fnd's [es6-seed](https://github.com/FND/es6-seed). Features both ES2015 as well as SCSS. For the integration of the asset pipeline in Rails, it uses the [rails-external-asset-pipeline](https://github.com/fejo-dk/rails_external_asset_pipeline) gem. The external asset pipeline can be found [here](https://github.com/fejo-dk/asset-pipeline).
